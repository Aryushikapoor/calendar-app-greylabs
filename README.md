# ReactJS Calendar Application Report

## Page 1: Project Overview and Objectives

### Introduction
This report outlines the development of a comprehensive ReactJS-based calendar application. The project aims to create a user-friendly, feature-rich calendar that allows users to manage events efficiently while adhering to modern React development practices.

### Objective
The primary objective is to develop a calendar application that enables users to view, add, edit, and delete events. The application will incorporate state management, routing, and mock API integration, focusing on performance, responsiveness, and user experience.

### Key Features
1. Monthly Calendar View
2. Event Management (Add, Edit, Delete)
3. Event Details Display
4. Event Filtering by Category
5. Error Handling
6. Responsive Design

### Technical Stack
- Frontend: ReactJS
- State Management: React Hooks and Context API
- Routing: React Router
- Date Manipulation: date-fns library
- API Mocking: Beeceptor
- Deployment: Vercel

## Page 2: Technical Implementation

### 1. Calendar Component
- Displays a monthly calendar grid
- Utilizes date-fns for date manipulation and formatting
- Implements click functionality for day cells
- Dynamically renders events fetched from the mock API

### 2. State Management
- Leverages React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
- Implements Context API for global state management
- Manages event data and filter states

### 3. Event Management
- Add Event:
  - Modal form for new event creation
  - Fields: title, description, date, category
- Edit Event:
  - Modal with pre-filled current event details
  - Allows modification of all fields
- Delete Event:
  - Option to remove events from the calendar
- API Integration:
  - Uses Beeceptor to mock CRUD operations

### 4. Routing
- Implements React Router for navigation
- Main routes:
  - "/" - Calendar view
  - "/event/:id" - Event details page

### 5. Event Filtering
- Dropdown or toggle interface for category selection
- Filters events based on Work/Personal categories

### 6. Mock API with Beeceptor
Endpoints:
- GET /events: Retrieve all events
- POST /events: Add a new event
- PUT /events/{id}: Edit an existing event
- DELETE /events/{id}: Remove an event

## Page 3: User Experience and Conclusion

### User Experience Considerations
1. Intuitive Interface:
   - Clear layout with easily identifiable calendar elements
   - Smooth transitions between views and actions

2. Responsive Design:
   - Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
   - Consistent functionality across different screen sizes

3. Error Handling:
   - User-friendly error messages for API failures
   - Form validation to prevent incorrect data submission

4. Performance Optimization:
   - Efficient state management to minimize re-renders
   - Lazy loading of components for improved initial load time

### Deployment
The application is deployed using Vercel, providing:
- Fast and reliable hosting
- Seamless integration with React
- Automatic deployments on code updates

### Future Enhancements
1. Integration with a real backend API
2. Additional view options (weekly, daily)
3. Recurring event support
4. User authentication and personalized calendars
5. Integration with external calendars (Google, Outlook)

### Conclusion
The ReactJS-based calendar application successfully meets the outlined requirements, providing a robust solution for event management. Key achievements include:

1. Comprehensive CRUD operations for events
2. Effective use of modern React practices (hooks, context, routing)
3. Responsive design ensuring cross-device compatibility
4. Mock API integration facilitating development and testing
5. Error handling and user feedback mechanisms

The application stands ready for production deployment, with a solid foundation for future enhancements and integrations. Its modular design and adherence to React best practices ensure maintainability and scalability, making it a valuable tool for users seeking efficient event management.
